        <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-blue-700">Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="mb-4"><strong>Last updated: [Date]</strong></p>
        
        <p class="mb-4">Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") carefully before using the KKoin Tube Telegram Mini App (the "App").</p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">By accessing or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, you may not access the App.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">2. Description of Service</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">KKoin Tube provides a service where users can watch advertisements provided by third-party ad networks (such as Adsgram, Monetag, RichAds, and Telega.io) in exchange for "Kkoin" points. These points are a digital reward within the App and are not a cryptocurrency.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">3. User Conduct</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">You agree not to use the App to:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-2">
            <li>Use any automated system (bots, scripts, or spiders) to access the App or watch ads.</li>
            <li>Create multiple accounts.</li>
            <li>Engage in any activity that is fraudulent or intended to abuse the earning system.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-4">Violation of these rules may result in the immediate termination of your account and forfeiture of all your Kkoin points.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">4. Earning and Withdrawals</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">The App provides Kkoin points for successfully viewing advertisements. The conversion rate (e.g., 10,000 Kkoin = 1 USDT) and withdrawal requirements are subject to change at our discretion.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">To be eligible for withdrawal, you must meet the minimum point threshold AND the minimum referral threshold as stated on the "Wallet" page. We reserve the right to verify all ad views and referrals before processing a withdrawal. Any points earned through fraudulent means or from unverified ad network postbacks will be deducted from your balance.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">5. Disclaimers</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">The App is provided "AS IS." We do not guarantee that the App will be available at all times or that all ad networks will be available. We are not responsible for the content of third-party advertisements.</p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">6. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last updated" date of these Terms.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">7. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact us through our official Telegram channel: <a href="https://t.me/kkoinearner" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline" target="_blank">https://t.me/kkoinearner</a>.</p>
